My first attempt at making a telegram moderation bot :)

Commands: 
Note: Admin permissions are required for the bot to function!
                         âš’ Admin commands
                         !ban - Bans a specified guild member.
                         !mute 15m (30m, 1h, 6h, 1d) - Mutes a specified guild member
                         !unmute - Unmutes a user
                         !del - Deletes a message
                         !pin - Pins a message
                         !unpin - Unpins a message
                         !me - Get user info
                         All commands except the latter should be replied to the user for them to work! 
                         
Setting Up:
Go to config.py and change the admin ID and the bot token :D
